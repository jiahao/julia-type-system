=================

A nascent paper or three about the type system in Julia

*Timing Results*

The timing results are reversed ordered, so `llvm01` is the last llvm pass to run and llvm29 is the first.
The inference passes are ordered in an similar way.  `inference04` are timings with inference completely turned off.
Not all benchmarks survived having all optimizations turned off.

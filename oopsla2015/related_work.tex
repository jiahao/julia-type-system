\section{Related Work}

The more common programming languages that support dynamic multiple dispatch
are Cecil~\cite{Chambers1992,Chambers1994}, Common Lisp with
CLOS~\cite{Bobrow1988}, Clojure~\cite{Hickey2008} and Dylan~\cite{dylanman}.
These languages also differ in the dispatch rules: Cecil, like Julia, employs
symmetric multiple dispatch; CLOS and Dylan resolve ambiguities by matching
arguments from left to right, and Clojure's dispatch rules are
customizable based on user-specifiable rules. The method dispatchers are also
limited in their expressiveness by the type system of their host languages.
Clojure's multimethods are not a core language construct and hence interact
only weakly with built-in types. Dispatch in CLOS is class-based and excludes
parametric types. Cecil's type system supports subtype polymorphism but not
type parameters. Dylan supports CLOS-style class-based dispatch, and also
let-polymorphism in limited types, which is a restricted form of parametric
polymorphism. However, Dylan does allows for multiple inheritance.

\section{Introductory Example}
In this section, we demonstrate some of the challenges involved in reasoning about types for scientific programs and then describe how Julia's type system addresses these issues.

\TODO{Find an example that works both for demonstrating what's hard about scientific programs and showing off the Julia type system.}

\subsection{The Difficulty of Assigning Types to Scientific Programs}
\TODO{Explain the example.}

\TODO{Explain how static types would be a nightmare.}

\subsection{Using Julia}
\TODO{Explain how Julia makes things nice, first in terms of the code. Use the example to give a mini Julia tutorial here.}

\subsection{Dispatch in Julia}
\TODO{Now explain how Julia is dispatching on this example and allude to all the speedup stuff that is going to be explained later.}
